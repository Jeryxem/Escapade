# What you must know before playing escapade

First of all, welcome to our fun mining world! Below are important information for developers and players alike.

## Important note (for developers)

To be able to test the game to its full potential and discover all of its features, consider enabling the spawning of minerals on demand. The game supports a hidden feature, whereby when the key `E` is pressed on the player's keyboard, minerals will be dropped randomly on the map. Pressing the `E` key multiple times will repeat the process, until the map is filled with minerals, which the player can then mine for a vast amount of mineral points.

The purpose of that feature is to allow the player to collect as many mineral points as possible to explore the potential of the Food Exchange Center and purchase more weapons to facilitate the progression to next levels, where some formulas (such as the calculation of food value or energy value) are recomputed.

To enable this mineral feature, simply uncomment `Lines 1097 - 1101` in the file `Escapade.cs`. The code should look like this:

``` if (SwinGame.KeyTyped(KeyCode.EKey)) { GetWorld().PutMinerals(); } ```
